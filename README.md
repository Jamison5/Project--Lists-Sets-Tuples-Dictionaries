# Project--Lists-Sets-Tuples-Dictionaries
Week 3 Project / Python Programming

## Project Scenario

You continue your successful career in the small software company that focuses on creating programs that are used at high schools to teach mathematical concepts. As you have considerably developed your programming skills, you are now being assigned a very important task. In one of the company products, there is a data processing pipeline that receives data of various kinds, handles some basic operations, and sends the data forward.

The component you will be focusing on handling the fundamental Python container objects (`list`, `set`, `tuple`, `dict`). Your task is to implement a small set of functions that would handle operations, such as container creation or transformation, and element access, update, insertion, or removal. Specifically, this means that there is just a single function named, e.g., add_item and this function can be used to add elements to a `list`, a `set`, a `tuple`, or a `dict`. Developers using this function do not have to care about handling the details of manipulating different containers. The developer simply knows that if they call the function it will take care of the details and returns the updated container.

## Project Goals

In this project, you are going to work on 1 task:

In task 1, you will implement the `create_container` function that creates an empty data container of the type specified in the `container_type` parameter. Then, you will implement the `access_item` function that handles access to an element in any of the basic data containers. After that, you will implement the `add_item` function that handles the addition of an element to any of the basic data containers. Additionally, you will implement the `remove_item` function that handles the removal of an element from any of the basic data containers. Then, you will implement the `update_item` function that handles the modification of an element in any of the basic data containers. Finally, you will implement the `convert_container` function that transforms a provided data container into a container of a different type.
